# DETranet

A group of inspired college students decided to make a bank system called DETranet.
It will be used only by the employees of the bank (customers will not have access).
After having taken inside information from a greek bank we made classes for each employee and the two basic departments: Deposit and Loans.
Apart from the code that appears to the command line, we decided to make a database and enhance our code with graphical user interface.
